# Research-Portfolio
This is a collection of the projects I worked on while a student researcher at OSU in the Physics department. I have split up project topics in different folders and inside each folder you will find some type of write up or presentation on the project and any coding that went with that project. Here is an overview of the contents in each folder.

*I suggest downloading a zip of this. Most items aren't visable on GitHub.*

### RET_PhasedArrayOptimization
*	(*START HERE*) **LeoDeerRETPresentation.pdf** – Presentation given to the RET Collaboration which gives an overview and reports on the results of this project.
*	(*START HERE*) **PhasedArrayOptimization.ipynb** – Optimization code used to find best design for a phased array.
*	**ExamplePhasedArray.ipynb** – Simulates and creates plots of a single phased array design.
*	**optimizerNAnpyMeep1.py & optimizerNAnpyMeep1.py** – Optimization code that uses finite difference time domain methods (not used in final results).
*	The rest is data and plots from PhasedArrayOptimization.ipynb used to find results and software to help PhasedArrayOptimization.ipynb run.

### RET_ParaPropImprovements
*	(*START HERE*) **AttemptsToImproveParaProp.pdf** – A writeup on my work to improve a parabolic equation solver developed by the RET collaboration.
*	(*START HERE*) **DipoleComparison.ipynb** – Code used to compare different versions of the parabolic equation solver with finite difference time domain EM solvers.
*	Data and other software to help DipoleComparison.ipynb run.


### GENETIS
*	**CurvedBiconeProject.pdf** – Contains an overview of the last project I worked on with the GENETIS collaboration
